Welcome to the Patika Plus Gala Night!

## Task Overview

In this exercise, your objective is to create a list containing the names of visitors and then iterate through this list to print each name individually. You can use either a for loop or a foreach loop to accomplish this.

## Instructions

1. *Create a List*: Define a list that will hold the names of the visitors.
2. *Add Names*: Populate this list with the names of the visitors.
3. *Iterate and Print*:
   - Use a for loop or a foreach loop to go through each element in the list.
   - Print each name to the console.

## Example Scenario

Imagine you are organizing a gala event and you have a list of attendees. You need to display each attendee's name on the screen to verify the guest list. This exercise will help you understand how to work with lists and loops in C#.

## Expected Output

The output should display the names of all the visitors, each on a new line.

## Tips

- To create and manage the list, you will use C#'s List<T> class.
- When adding elements, you can use methods provided by the List<T> class.
- Iterating through the list can be done with either for or foreach loops based on your preference.

Feel free to implement this exercise and explore different ways to achieve the desired result.
